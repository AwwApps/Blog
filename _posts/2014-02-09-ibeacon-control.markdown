### Control

One last aspect that we found interesting is the element control. Based on the current implementation of the iBeacon ranging API all the processing happens on the device you are using. This means you stay in control over which app tracks iBeacons and which not, as well as regarding the notifications you trigger and get in a push way. 

So even while connecting to your enviroment more and more you don't give up the control over your the processing of your data. All access and processing is centralized and channeled of the device you carry with you. 

We like that.

![Pixel Ruler Generator]({{ site.url }}/images/post_ruler.svg)

This goes out to all developers and designers dealing with ... screens!

For pure relexation we just built a little online generator for creating rulers to measure distances in pixels on your screen. No software required. Just **download** a ruler template generated for the dpi you enter, **print** the PDF and start to **measure** margins, paddings and CGRects on your iPhone, Macbook, or any other screens.

â†’ Go to our Pixel Ruler Generator page and [give it a try](http://labs.awwapps.com/ruler/)

*Context* At moment we are working hard on an a major update of [Pinning](http://pinning.awwapps.com) and another super secret project. To stay fresh and keep our minds from running into the infamous reality distortion field we created a new Labs page that will feature tools and scripts we built as side projects worth sharing. This Pixel Ruler Generator is the first one.

Have fun measuring.

![Pausing Launch Here and Travel Radar]({{ site.url }}/images/post_pausing_launch-here_travel_radar.svg)

We decided to pause our apps <strong>Launch Here</strong> and <strong>Travel Radar</strong>. This means we will pull them from the AppStore shortly. In their current state they don&rsquo;t fulfil our own expectations for quality, so we&rsquo;d rather not want anybody to purchase them and being disappointed.

Our resources are very limited. In the last couple of weeks it became clear that we have to make sacrifices to stay motivated, focused and keep moving forward.

We still believe in the use cases for both apps. In fact we were working on significantly improved new versions for quite a while. We hoped to have a smoother transition but developing the new versions simply took longer than expected. Pulling the apps will help us removing maintenance pressures and avoid false expectations regarding upcoming releases.

If you purchased one of the apps recently and feel unhappy with this move, please feel free to make use of Apples&rsquo;s app refund option â€“ no problem.

This is a step we didn&rsquo;t take lightly. But after going back and forth on this over and over again in the last couple of weeks it does feel right. We hope for your understanding.

![Bringing Context Home]({{ site.url }}/images/post_bringing_context_home.svg)

Last week we gave a talk at the [Bitspiration](http://festival.bitspiration.com) conference in wonderful Krakow wrapping up some of our experiences building context-aware apps for iOS. Here are the slides as well as a mind map. A video recording might also be coming up soon. Look out.

### Summary and Slides

> iBeacons are the best way to connect your apps to the real world by adding micro-location based context triggers. While commercial environments already started embracing different iBeacon scenarios, areas that are even closer to our hearts still leave a lot to explore: Home and Productivity.

> In this presentation you will see how to identify meaningful iBeacon based app use cases, get first hand insights on common implementation and UI challenges and learn about the special considerations facing a casual market.
